I am a Computer Engineer and Researcher with a passion for designing efficient, secure, and scalable computing systems. My work focuses on the intersection of low-level hardware architecture and high-level enterprise solutions.

My foundation in academia was built at the University of Sharjah, where I graduated with first-class honors and served as a **Teaching and Research Assistant**. In this role, I made significant contributions to the Distributed and Network Systems (DNS) research group, co-developing a novel, low-power IoT chip architecture. I also honed my pedagogical skills by mentoring undergraduate students, guiding them through complex computer science and engineering principles.

This rigorous background in systems-level research and problem-solving directly informs my current work as a **ServiceNow Solution Consultant** at **RaqMEA**. Here, I apply a systems-thinking approach to architect and implement bespoke cloud solutions that drive digital transformation and streamline enterprise workflows for a diverse portfolio of clients. I am driven by the challenge of bridging theoretical concepts with practical, high-impact applications.
